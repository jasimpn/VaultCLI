# Password Manager (CLI)

A multi-user, terminal-based password manager written in Python. Each user's vault
is protected by their own master password — passwords are never stored in plain text.

## Features

- Multi-user support (separate encrypted vault per user)
- Master password required to unlock a user's vault
- AES-based encryption (via `Fernet`) for every stored password
- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation (600,000 iterations) for both password hashing
  and encryption keys
- Random salt generated per encryption operation
- Built-in strong password generator
- Password strength checker
- Add / view / delete vault entries
- Vault and user files locked to owner-only permissions on Unix systems (`chmod 600`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python password_manager_plain.py
```

You'll be prompted to sign up or log in. Once logged in, you can:

1. Add a new password (typed manually or auto-generated)
2. View saved passwords (decrypted with your master password)
3. Delete a password
4. Generate a strong random password
5. Check the strength of a password
6. Log out

## How it works

- **Signup:** your master password is hashed with PBKDF2 (salted) and stored in `users.json`. The raw password itself is never saved.
- **Vault:** each user gets a `<username>_vault.json` file. Each entry's password is encrypted individually with a key derived from your master password and a random salt.
- **Login:** your master password is verified against the stored hash using a timing-safe comparison.

## Security notes

- Your master password exists in memory only for the duration of your session — it is never written to disk.
- File permission locking (`chmod 600`) is enforced only on Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS); it has no effect on Windows.
- This project is intended as a learning/demo project. For real-world password management, use an audited, actively maintained tool.
